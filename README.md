# Semaphore SVG

This is a project specifically meant for Hacktoberfest 2023. The idea is simple: 
take the provided HTML page, semaphore.html, and convert it to use scalable 
vector graphics (SVG). Improve it in other ways that you can think of, without 
using any kind of graphics format other than SVG.
