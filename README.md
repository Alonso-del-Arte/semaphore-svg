# Semaphore SVG

This is a project that specifically meant for Hacktoberfest 2023. But now I'm 
trying it for Hacktoberfest 2024.

The idea is simple, or at least I thought it was simple: take the provided HTML 
page, semaphore.html, and convert it to use scalable vector graphics (SVG). 
Improve it in other ways that you can think of, without using any kind of 
graphics format other than SVG.
