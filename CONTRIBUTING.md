# Guidelines for Hacktoberfest 2024 contributors

* Use only HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SVG.
* No Node, no npm install, no npx create. Pull requests demanding Node will be 
rejected as spam or not helpful.
* You may delete graphics files that are not SVG files once you're sure they're 
no longer needed.
* You may add directories if you can justify their existence.
* Before making a pull request, be sure to compare what you've created to actual 
stoplights or pictures of actual stoplights. Because if I have to ask whether a 
stoplight really looks like that, I'm rejecting your pull request.
